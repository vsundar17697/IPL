In this application, the aim is to connect to mysql database and perform user authentication,
using JSP.

It is enough to place the jstl.jar and standard.jar in Tomcat's lib instead of having to keep in WEB-INF of every web-application.

To run the mysql server, run the wamp server first, and then go to mysql in wamp server folder location and then type the following in the command prompt : 
			mysql.exe -u root
